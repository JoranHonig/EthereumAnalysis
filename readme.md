This project is meant to perform automatic analysis when smart contracts are created on the ethereum blockchain.

At the moment we only use [mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) as analysis tool but this will be extended in the future
Additionally this now runs as a single instance tool, going forward a more distributed approach might be possible
